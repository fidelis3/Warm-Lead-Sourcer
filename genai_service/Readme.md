# Warm Lead Sourcer - GenAI Service
An intelligent, AI driven lead sourcer. Warm Lead Sourcer automates the process of finding, analyzing and scoring potential candidates from the web. It uses Google Dorking for sourcing and Large Language Models(Groq) for cognitive scoring and data cleaning.

## Features
Smart Sourcing: Uses specialized Google search queries(SERPER) to find LinkedIn account.
AI Scoring Agent: Automatically rates candidates from 1-10 based on job alignment, keywords and experience using Groq.
Data Cleaning Agent: Normalizes messy names and job titles extracted from search snippets.
Contact enrichment: email generation (e.g. firstname.lastname@university.edu) for outreach.
Includes Rate limiting (to prevent spam) and pydantic validation.
CSV export: Instantly download score leads as a formatted spreadsheet.

## Tech Stack
Backend Framework: FastAPI(python)
LLM Engine: Serper.dev (Google Search API)
AI Orchestration: Langchain
Validation: Pydantic
Security: SlowAPI(Rate Limiting)
